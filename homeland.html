<h1><div style="text-align: center;">Dominican Republic</div></h1>
<img src="DR.jpg" width="500" length="200">
<p><div style="text-align: center;">The Dominican Republic is a small caribbean island that is well known for it's beaches and culture and shares its border with Haiti. Our national sport is baseball which is what is my preferred sport. The Dominican was the first island that Christopher Columbus first discovered in the Americas which make the capital Santo Domingo the oldest city in the new world. Our flag is also the only flag to have a bible on it. </div></p>
